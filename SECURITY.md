# Security Policy

## Supported releases

Only the latest available release for each platform receives security fixes.
`v0.0.1` is the first public release in the reset version line.

The historical `v0.0.1` Universal DMG is unsigned and unnotarized. Public
availability is not an Apple security review, signing claim, or notarization
claim. Each platform is published only after its own applicable signing and
installed-application gates pass. A Windows release does not require Developer
ID, Apple notarization, or a macOS artifact. Windows support in the source tree
does not mean a Windows stable installer has been released.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not disclose a suspected vulnerability in a public issue. Use
[GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Ice-teapop/algolatch/security/advisories/new)
and include the following information. GitHub requires you to sign in before
opening the private report form.

- the affected application and macOS or Windows versions;
- a minimal reproduction without private source code or API keys;
- the expected and observed security boundary;
- whether the issue involves untrusted C, filesystem access, IPC, Trace,
  source rewriting, AI credentials, network context, or process cleanup; and
- whether you observed any source, project, credential, or conversation data
  leaving its documented boundary.

The project aims to acknowledge or provide a status update within seven days.
Fix timing depends on severity, reproducibility, and the affected boundary.

## Source-authoritative editing boundary

`main.c` is the only executable source of truth. Flow coordinates, sidecars,
AI conversations, model output, and analysis results cannot directly redefine
program semantics.

A connection or structured edit is accepted only after exact snapshot
validation, candidate-source generation, full reparsing, lossless round-trip
validation, and the required CFG postcondition. Raw text, macro boundaries,
partial CFG, unsafe fan-out, cross-syntax connections, and ambiguous anchors
fail closed.

Deleting or corrupting `flow-view.json`, `scenarios.json`,
`run-history.json`, `tutorial-progress.json`, or `ai-project.json` must not
change `main.c`. A source-fingerprint mismatch invalidates stale flow, Trace,
run, lesson, and AI-edit evidence instead of attempting a guessed migration.

## AI provider and credential boundary

Network AI is optional and disabled until the user configures a provider.

- API keys are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage` and bound to a provider.
- Renderer code receives public configuration and `hasCredential`; it cannot
  read plaintext credentials, ciphertext, request headers, or generic IPC.
- Requests run only in the Electron main process over HTTPS.
- Each request is limited to the selected provider's registered official host.
- Redirects and arbitrary user-defined endpoints are rejected.
- The app does not retry a key against another provider or silently change the
  selected model.
- Timeouts, response-size limits, strict JSON parsing, cancellation,
  malformed responses, and source changes fail closed.

Default AI context contains the current function and bounded diagnostic,
control-flow, run, and conversation evidence. It excludes filesystem paths,
stdin, program arguments, fixtures, and credentials. Full source is sent only
after the user explicitly enables Review changes or Agent mode. The AI window
keeps this full-source disclosure visible while either mode is active.

Third-party providers remain responsible for their own transport, account,
processing, and retention controls after a request reaches their official
service.

## AI Project and source-change boundary

Each managed workspace may store one bounded `ai-project.json`. The main
process validates opaque workspace IDs, exact request shapes, revisions,
message limits, file size, regular-file status, and schema version. Mutations
use a temporary file, `fsync`, and atomic rename. Conversation files never
store provider credentials, request headers, absolute paths, or arbitrary
endpoints.

AI source editing defaults to read-only. Enabling review or controlled
execution does not grant filesystem, command, or arbitrary code-execution
access. The model may only return a structured replacement proposal. The
application binds it to the current workspace revision and source fingerprint,
creates a checkpoint, produces an exact diff, and routes it through the normal
source-authoritative validation path. Review mode also requires explicit user
approval before commit.

Stale, non-unique, malformed, raw, partial, locked, parse-degrading, or
CFG-degrading proposals are rejected. AI cannot create or delete files, write
outside the managed workspace, execute commands, or bypass undo history.

## Trace boundary

Trace uses temporary shadow-source instrumentation; it does not edit project
source. Each session is tied to a source fingerprint and one run authorization.
Sessions support cancellation and stop at 10,000 events or 8 MiB. Unsupported
C layouts, source changes, malformed batches, stale sessions, or resource-limit
failures cannot silently produce a real-path conclusion.

Teaching simulation is visually and structurally separate from real execution.
Simulation output and timing never enter real performance history or represent
observed program behavior.

## Local code-execution boundary

The application compiles and runs C programs on the user's computer. Treat
unknown C files as executable code. Resource limits and best-effort isolation
reduce risk but do not turn arbitrary native code into a safe document format.

When the app reports that macOS Seatbelt isolation is unavailable, trusted-only
execution requires native confirmation for the exact request. The authorization
is single-use and binds the displayed request summary. Renderer code cannot
grant, broaden, or reuse it.

On Windows 10/11 x64, AlgoLatch uses a locked, bundled llvm-mingw toolchain and
launches compiled programs through `algolatch-job-host.exe`. The broker creates
a Windows Job Object before resuming the program, bounds process count,
aggregate memory and CPU time, and terminates the process tree when the job
closes. The application verifies the locked toolchain and broker digests before
use and fails closed if they are absent or changed.

Windows Job Object limits are not a filesystem or network sandbox. A C program
can access files and network resources available to the current Windows user.
Do not run unknown C on a device or account containing data you are unwilling
to expose.

## Distribution trust boundary

Download the `v0.0.1` DMG and `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the same GitHub Release,
then run:

```sh
shasum -a 256 --check SHA256SUMS.txt
```

Do not open the DMG if verification fails. Gatekeeper may require Control-click
→ Open or explicit approval in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. Do not
disable Gatekeeper globally.

The formal AlgoLatch builder requires a Developer ID Application identity,
Hardened Runtime, a fixed minimal entitlement set, Apple notarization, stapling,
quarantine-aware Gatekeeper assessment, Universal binary verification, and an
installed-application regression. Missing credentials or any failed check stops
the release before upload.

The formal Windows builder requires a complete `WIN_CSC_LINK` and
`WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, Authenticode-signs the NSIS installer, application and
uninstaller, and verifies their signer plus an install/launch/run/uninstall
regression on Windows x64. The embedded compiler and Job Object broker retain
their staging bytes so the runtime manifest remains valid; they are protected
in transit by the signed installer and checked against fixed hashes before use.

An Authenticode-valid download can still show Microsoft SmartScreen reputation
warnings when its certificate or download history has not accumulated enough
reputation. The project does not describe Authenticode as a guarantee that
SmartScreen will suppress every prompt.

The separate macOS Beta builder explicitly disables signing and notarization,
writes to `release-beta/`, and includes `unsigned` in the filename. It is a
test package, not an Apple-verified stable release. Gatekeeper can require
Control-click → Open or explicit approval in **System Settings → Privacy &
Security**; never disable Gatekeeper globally.
The Windows Beta follows the same separation under `release-windows-beta/` and
must never be described as Authenticode-verified.

A formal Windows Release can be created after the Windows Authenticode and
installed-state jobs succeed. It does not wait for Apple credentials or macOS
verification. A future formal macOS Release remains blocked until its Developer
ID, notarization, Gatekeeper, and installed-state gates pass. Release jobs use
only already-verified platform assets, produce matching checksums, reject an
existing Release, and never overwrite assets.
