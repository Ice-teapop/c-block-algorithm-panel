AlgoLatch

Copyright (c) 2026 HAN Chen. Released under the MIT License; see `LICENSE`.

The distributed application includes third-party open-source software. Major
components include Electron, Vite, TypeScript, CodeMirror, Tree-sitter,
web-tree-sitter, Vitest, Playwright, and their transitive dependencies. Their
copyright notices and license declarations remain subject to their respective
licenses. The project's MIT License does not replace those licenses.

The complete locked dependency inventory and the license or NOTICE texts found
in the release dependency tree are included in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and in the packaged app.

The workbench's flow projection, local evidence mentor, scenario provider,
runtime analysis, and guided lessons are application components. Local evidence
hints do not contact an external model.

The optional AI assistant can contact OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter,
DeepSeek, Zhipu GLM, Kimi China, or Kimi Global after the user supplies an API
key, selects a provider, and starts a request. These services are independent
third parties and are not bundled with, operated by, or endorsed by this
project. Their names and trademarks belong to their respective owners.

API credentials are stored with operating-system-backed encryption when
available. Each project may store bounded local AI conversations. AI source
editing is disabled by default and remains subject to explicit permission and
the workbench's source-authoritative validation path when enabled.

No Apple endorsement is implied by use of macOS, Apple clang, Gatekeeper,
Developer ID, Hardened Runtime, or notarization terminology. The historical
`v0.0.1` Universal DMG is intentionally unsigned and unnotarized. AlgoLatch
formal releases require Developer ID signing and Apple notarization, but are not
distributed through or endorsed by the Mac App Store.
