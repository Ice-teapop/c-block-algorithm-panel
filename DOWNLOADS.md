# AlgoLatch downloads

Official downloads are published only through the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Ice-teapop/algolatch/releases). GitHub's
automatically generated **Source code** archives are not application installers.

## Available cross-platform preview

`v0.1.1-preview.1` is an **unsigned prerelease** built from one source revision:

- [Download the macOS Universal DMG](https://github.com/Ice-teapop/algolatch/releases/download/v0.1.1-preview.1/AlgoLatch-0.1.1-preview.1-unsigned-universal.dmg)
- [Download the Windows x64 EXE](https://github.com/Ice-teapop/algolatch/releases/download/v0.1.1-preview.1/AlgoLatch-Setup-0.1.1-preview.1-unsigned-x64.exe)
- [Download the shared SHA-256 checksum](https://github.com/Ice-teapop/algolatch/releases/download/v0.1.1-preview.1/SHA256SUMS.txt)
- [Read the preview release notes](https://github.com/Ice-teapop/algolatch/releases/tag/v0.1.1-preview.1)

The macOS application is ad-hoc signed but has no Developer ID signature or
Apple notarization. Gatekeeper can require Control-click → Open or approval in
System Settings → Privacy & Security. The Windows installer has no
Authenticode signature, so Windows can display an unknown-publisher or
SmartScreen warning. Verify the checksum and install only if you accept these
boundaries.

## Tutorial testing notice

This preview substantially expands the course system, semantic animation and
runtime-state visualization. Some courses may still contain interaction,
layout, localization or result bugs. If you find one, open a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/Ice-teapop/algolatch/issues/new/choose) with
the course number, operating system and display scale, reproduction steps and
a screenshot. Do not include private source code, API keys or exploitable
security details in a public issue.

The Windows installer is one-click, per-user and includes its locked C
toolchain. The macOS DMG is Universal for Apple Silicon and Intel. Uninstalling
AlgoLatch on either platform does not remove managed projects in Documents.

## Windows signed release

The stable Windows release will be linked here only after signing, signature
verification and installed-application regression all succeed.

The SignPath Foundation application was unsuccessful, and the public Preview
does not claim a trusted publisher signature. A future signed release requires
an appropriate certificate and must follow the project's
[Code signing policy](./CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md).

When available, the official release will contain:

- `AlgoLatch-Setup-<version>-x64.exe`; and
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

## Safety

Do not download installers from issue attachments, Actions artifacts, mirrors
or third-party file hosts. Verify the published SHA-256 checksum before opening
an installer. A valid signature proves publisher identity and file integrity;
Microsoft SmartScreen reputation can still take time to accumulate for a new
release.
